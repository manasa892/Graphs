1.Understanding Aggregates
import numpy as np
import codecademylib3_seaborn
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


gradebook = pd.read_csv("gradebook.csv")
print(gradebook)

assignment1 =  gradebook[gradebook.assignment_name == "Assignment 1"]
print(assignment1)

asn1_median = np.median(assignment1.grade)

print(asn1_median)

2.Aggregate Functions
#sns.set() prints the default theme of the seaborn theme
